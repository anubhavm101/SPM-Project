Project Title: Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)
Project Overview
The Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) leverages Artificial Intelligence to provide students and professionals with personalized, real-time learning experiences. It addresses the limitations of traditional and online learning platforms by offering adaptive content, instant feedback, and gamification, thereby enhancing engagement and improving learning outcomes.

Problem Statement
•	High dropout rates in MOOCs due to lack of personalization and real-time feedback.
•	Limited engagement and static learning paths in existing platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy.
•	Challenges for educators to cater to diverse learning styles and provide individualized feedback.

Key Objectives
•	Develop a system offering personalized learning pathways.
•	Enhance student engagement through interactive features and gamification.
•	Provide educators with tools to monitor progress and tailor support.

Main Features
•	Adaptive learning paths based on individual progress.
•	Real-time feedback for instant correction and improvement.
•	Gamified elements like badges, leaderboards, and rewards.
•	Integration with LMS platforms such as Moodle and Google Classroom.
